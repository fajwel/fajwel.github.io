My name is Fajwel (pronounce "fayvel"). I am a postdoctoral researcher at [ENS Paris](https://www.di.ens.fr/) and [LSCE](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/), member of the research group of [Philippe Ciais](https://www.lsce.ipsl.fr/Phocea/Pisp/index.php?nom=philippe.ciais), and the [AI4Forest](https://anr.fr/Projet-ANR-22-FAI1-0002) project.
My current research focuses on the estimation of forest attributes (e.g., height) and their temporal evolution at a very high resolution (less than 2 meters) and at scale (country or greater), using remote sensing data and AI. I am also very curious about other applications of AI for environmental sciences.

From 2016 till 2023 I have worked in several AI startups. In 2016 I served as Chief Data Scientist at [Kayrros](https://www.kayrros.com/), a startup that delivers insights on energy markets using satellite imagery and AI. Subsequently, from 2017 till 2023 I have been the Chief Science Officer and co-founder of [Sancare](https://www.sancare.fr/), a startup that automates the processing of hospitals' medical health reports with AI to streamine administrative tasks and retrieve information for real world evidence studies.

I hold an engineering degree from [ENSAE](https://www.ensae.fr/en), a Master of Science from [Columbia University](https://www.columbia.edu/), and a PhD in applied mathematics from [Ecole Polytechnique Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr/education/doctorat/ecole-doctorale-ip-paris) (advisors [Alexandre d'Aspremont](https://www.di.ens.fr/~aspremon/) and [Francis Bach](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/)).
